datacamp SQL project:
TV, Halftime Shows, and the Big Game


Project Description
Note: this Project is soft launched, which means you may experience bugs. Please click "Report an Issue" in the top-right corner of the Project interface to provide feedback.

Whether or not you like football, the Super Bowl is a spectacle. There's drama in the form of blowouts, comebacks, and controversy in the games themselves. There are the ridiculously expensive ads, some hilarious, others gut-wrenching, thought-provoking, and weird. The half-time shows with the biggest musicians in the world, sometimes riding giant mechanical tigers or leaping from the roof of the stadium. And in this Project, you will find out how some of the elements of this show interact with each other. You will answer questions like:

What are the most extreme game outcomes?
How does the game affect television viewership?
How have viewership, TV ratings, and ad cost evolved over time?
Who are the most prolific musicians in terms of halftime show performances?
This Project gives you an opportunity to apply the skills from Joining Data in SQL and its prerequisite, Intro to SQL for Data Science.

The data used in this Project was scraped and polished from Wikipedia. The database it is stored in is made up of three tables, one with game data, one with TV broadcast data, and one with halftime musician performance data for all 52 Super Bowls through 2018.
